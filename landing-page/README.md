# Landing Page Project

This is my first project using javascript, CSS and HTML all together.
It is to be submitted to Udacity reviewers before 21st of Feb.

In this project, I was asked to create a dynamic navigation bar that adds links dynamically as per sections
created in the DOM body.

In addition to that, I had to make the active section dynamically change with scrolling according to current
scroll position to add effects to it.

Last, I had to make the navigation bar links trigger the user to desired section when clicking on it.

After completing the project, I tested the code speed and optimized it to be faster.

I depended on what I learnt throughout the course in Udacity.
